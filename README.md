* As a user, I want to add a recipe with ingredients and instructions, so I remember how to prepare my favorite dishes.
* As a user, I want to tag my recipes with different categories, so recipes are easier to find. A recipe can have many tags and a tag can have many recipes.
* As a user, I want to be able to update and delete tags, so I can have flexibility with how I categorize recipes.
* As a user, I want to edit my recipes, so I can make improvements or corrections to my recipes.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete recipes I don't like or use, so I don't have to see them as choices.
* As a user, I want to rate my recipes, so I know which ones are the best.
* As a user, I want to list my recipes by highest rated so I can see which ones I like the best.
* As a user, I want to see all recipes that use a certain ingredient, so I can more easily find recipes for the ingredients I have.
